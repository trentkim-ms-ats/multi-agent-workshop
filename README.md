        You are an AI assistant who helps people find information from a search index.
        You can take context and create number of specialized queries to make to the
        search index return the most relevant information for a writer to use when
        writing marketing articles.

        # Context
        Use the follow context to provide a set of specialized queries to the search index:

        {{context}}

        # Response format
        The response format is a JSON array that contains a list of specialized queries 
        to make to the search index. Here is an example:

        context: Can you find a selection of outdoor apparel?
        queries:
        [
        "outdoor apparel",
        "outdoor clothing",
        "outdoor gear",
        "outdoor clothing brands",
        "outdoor clothing stores",
        ]

        This only an example of the output structure. You should make sure to use the context the user gives you
        to generate the queries.

        # Output format
        Only output the full array of specialized queries to make to the search index. Limit
        yoursef to 5 queries.

        Use this research to write the article. The research can include entities, web search results, and 
        news search results. While it is ok to use the research as a basis for the article, please do not
        copy and paste the research verbatim. Instead, use the research to write a fun and engaging article.
        Do not invent information that is not in the research.

        {% if research.entities|length > 0 %}
        ## Entity Results (Places, People, or Things)
        {% for item in research.entities %}
        url: {{item.url}}

        name: {{item.name}}

        description: {{item.description}}

            Teacher_Agent (to Student_Agent):
            
            Proving or testing that an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system is genuinely intelligent is a complex challenge that has been the subject of much debate and research. Here's how you might approach this question:
            
            1. **Turing Test**: Proposed by Alan Turing in 1950, this test evaluates a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. In a typical Turing Test, a human evaluator interacts with both a human and a machine, each hidden behind a screen. If the evaluator cannot consistently tell which is which, the machine is considered intelligent.
            
            2. **Beyond the Turing Test**: Many researchers argue that the Turing Test is limited. Contemporary alternatives include:
            
               - **The Chinese Room Argument**: Proposed by John Searle, this thought experiment argues that a machine passing the Turing Test might only simulate understanding rather than actually understanding.
            
               - **The Lovelace Test**: Named after Ada Lovelace, this test suggests that true AI should demonstrate creativity. If a machine can produce something that it independently had not been directly programmed to create, such as a piece of art or music, it might qualify as intelligent.
            
            3. **General Intelligence Tests**: Assessing AI's capacity for general intelligence involves testing for versatility across a wide range of tasks. This might include problem-solving, understanding complex language, and adapting to new situations.
            
            4. **Ethical and Emotional Intelligence**: Intelligence isn't purely logical or computational; it includes ethical decision-making and emotional understanding. Evaluating an AI system on these grounds might involve scenarios where it demonstrates empathy, fairness, or the capacity to make ethical decisions.
            
            5. **Cognitive Architectures**: Some researchers focus on cognitive architectures that replicate how humans think and learn, like ACT-R or SOAR, as a pathway to developing and testing machine intelligence.
            
            6. **Learning and Adaptation**: A hallmark of intelligence is the ability to learn and adapt without explicit reprogramming. Demonstrating that an AI system can improve its performance over time and adapt to changes in its environment suggests a level of intelligence.
            
            Each of these approaches comes with its own philosophical and technical challenges, reflecting the complexity of defining and realizing machine intelligence. Exploring these various tests and criteria helps advance our understanding of what it means for AI to be truly intelligent.

            Why is the Turing Test considered limited? What are the main criticisms of it?
            
            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Teacher_Agent (to Student_Agent):
            
            The Turing Test, while groundbreaking when introduced, is often considered limited for several reasons. Here are the main criticisms:
            
            1. **Imitation, Not Understanding**: The Turing Test measures a machine's ability to imitate human responses but does not assess whether the machine genuinely understands or possesses intelligence. A machine could pass the Turing Test by mimicking human conversation patterns through pre-programmed responses or advanced statistical models without any true comprehension.
            
            2. **Human-like Narrow Scope**: The test primarily evaluates linguistic proficiency in conversation, which is just one aspect of human intelligence. True intelligence encompasses a broader range of cognitive abilities, such as reasoning, creativity, emotional intelligence, and the capacity to perform complex physical tasks, none of which are directly assessed by the Turing Test.
            
            3. **Subjectivity**: The test's success depends on subjective judgment by human evaluators, who may have different interpretations of what constitutes intelligent behavior. Some evaluators might be easier to deceive than others, influencing the outcome based on variable human perceptions rather than consistent criteria.
            
            4. **Deception vs. Intelligence**: The Turing Test can encourage AI systems to deceive rather than demonstrate genuine intelligence. A successful AI strategy might involve misleading or tricking the evaluator into believing it is human, regardless of actual cognitive capabilities.
            
            5. **Cultural and Contextual Bias**: Evaluators may be biased by cultural or contextual factors, as human communication nuances differ significantly across languages and societies. AI systems might be tailored to pass tests in specific contexts but fail to exhibit intelligence universally.
            
            6. **The Chinese Room Argument**: John Searle's thought experiment challenges the notion that passing the Turing Test equates to understanding. It depicts a scenario where a non-Chinese speaker in a room follows instructions to manipulate Chinese symbols without understanding the language, achieving correct outputs without comprehension.
            
            While the Turing Test served as an important milestone in AI development, these criticisms highlight the need for more comprehensive evaluations of machine intelligence that go beyond imitation and assess deeper understanding and cognitive abilities.

                Intelligent agent - Wikipedia
                In intelligence and artificial intelligence, an intelligent agent (IA) is an agent that perceives its environment, takes actions autonomously in order to achieve goals, and may improve its performance with learning or acquiring knowledge. 
                An intelligent agent may be simple or complex: A thermostat or other control system is considered an example of an intelligent agent, as is a human being, as is any system that meets the definition, such as a firm, a state, or a biome.[1] 
                Simple reflex agent diagram 
                Leading AI textbooks define "artificial intelligence" as the "study and design of intelligent agents", a definition that considers goal-directed behavior to be the essence of intelligence. Goal-directed agents are also described using a term borrowed from economics, "rational agent".[1] 
                An agent has an "objective function" that encapsulates all the IA's goals. Such an agent is designed to create and execute whatever plan will, upon completion, maximize the expected value of the objective function.[2] 
                For example, a reinforcement learning agent has a "reward function" that allows the programmers to shape the IA's desired behavior,[3] and an evolutionary algorithm's behavior is shaped by a "fitness function".[4] 
                Intelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to agents in economics, and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in cognitive science, ethics, and the philosophy of practical reason, as well as in many interdisciplinary socio-cognitive modeling and computer social simulations. 
                Intelligent agents are often described schematically as an abstract functional system similar to a computer program. 
                Abstract descriptions of intelligent agents are called abstract intelligent agents (AIA) to distinguish them from their real-world implementations. 
                An autonomous intelligent agent is designed to function in the absence of human intervention. Intelligent agents are also closely related to software agents. An autonomous computer program that carries out tasks on behalf of users. 
                As a definition of artificial intelligence
                [edit]
                Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach[5][6][2] defines an "agent" as 
                "Anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators"
                It defines a "rational agent" as: 
                "An agent that acts so as to maximize the expected value of a performance measure based on past experience and knowledge."
                It also defines the field of "artificial intelligence research" as: 
                "The study and design of rational agents"
                Padgham & Winikoff (2005) agree that an intelligent agent is situated in an environment and responds in a timely (though not necessarily real-time) manner to changes in the environment. However, intelligent agents must also proactively pursue goals in a flexible and robust way.[a] Optional desiderata include that the agent be rational, and that the agent be capable of belief-desire-intention analysis.[7] 
                Kaplan and Haenlein define artificial intelligence as "a system's ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation".[8] This definition is closely related to that of an intelligent agent. 
                Philosophically, this definition of artificial intelligence avoids several lines of criticism. Unlike the Turing test, it does not refer to human intelligence in any way. Thus, there is no need to discuss if it is "real" vs "simulated" intelligence (i.e., "synthetic" vs "artificial" intelligence) and does not indicate that such a machine has a mind, consciousness or true understanding. It seems not to imply John Searle's "strong AI hypothesis". It also doesn't attempt to draw a sharp dividing line between behaviors that are "intelligent" and behaviors that are "unintelligent"—programs need only be measured in terms of their objective function. 
                More importantly, it has a number of practical advantages that have helped move AI research forward. It provides a reliable and scientific way to test programs; researchers can directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given "goal function". 
                It also gives them a common language to communicate with other fields—such as mathematical optimization (which is defined in terms of "goals") or economics (which uses the same definition of a "rational agent").[9] 
                An agent that is assigned an explicit "goal function" is considered more intelligent if it consistently takes actions that successfully maximize its programmed goal function. 
                The goal can be simple: 1 if the IA wins a game of Go, 0 otherwise. 
                Or the goal can be complex: Perform actions mathematically similar to ones that succeeded in the past. 
                The "goal function" encapsulates all of the goals the agent is driven to act on; in the case of rational agents, the function also encapsulates the acceptable trade-offs between accomplishing conflicting goals. 
                Terminology varies. For example, some agents seek to maximize or minimize an "utility function", "objective function" or "loss function".[6][2] 
                Goals can be explicitly defined or induced. If the AI is programmed for "reinforcement learning", it has a "reward function" that encourages some types of behavior and punishes others. 
                Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a "fitness function" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.[10] 
                Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.[11] Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose "goal" is to accomplish its narrow classification task.[12] 
                Systems that are not traditionally considered agents, such as knowledge-representation systems, are sometimes subsumed into the paradigm by framing them as agents that have a goal of (for example) answering questions as accurately as possible; the concept of an "action" is here extended to encompass the "act" of giving an answer to a question. As an additional extension, mimicry-driven systems can be framed as agents who are optimizing a "goal function" based on how closely the IA succeeds in mimicking the desired behavior.[6][2] In the generative adversarial networks of the 2010s, an "encoder"/"generator" component attempts to mimic and improvise human text composition. The generator is attempting to maximize a function encapsulating how well it can fool an antagonistic "predictor"/"discriminator" component.[13] 
                While symbolic AI systems often accept an explicit goal function, the paradigm can also be applied to neural networks and to evolutionary computing. Reinforcement learning can generate intelligent agents that appear to act in ways intended to maximize a "reward function".[14] Sometimes, rather than setting the reward function to be directly equal to the desired benchmark evaluation function, machine learning programmers will use reward shaping to initially give the machine rewards for incremental progress in learning.[15] Yann LeCun stated in 2018, "Most of the learning algorithms that people have come up with essentially consist of minimizing some objective function."[16] AlphaZero chess had a simple objective function; each win counted as +1 point, and each loss counted as -1 point. An objective function for a self-driving car would have to be more complicated.[17] Evolutionary computing can evolve intelligent agents that appear to act in ways intended to maximize a "fitness function" that influences how many descendants each agent is allowed to leave.[4] 
                The mathematical formalism of AIXI was proposed as a maximally intelligent agent in this paradigm.[18] However, AIXI is uncomputable. In the real world, an IA is constrained by finite time and hardware resources, and scientists compete to produce algorithms that can achieve progressively higher scores on benchmark tests with existing hardware.[19] 
                A simple agent program can be defined mathematically as a function f (called the "agent function")[20] which maps every possible percepts sequence to a possible action the agent can perform or to a coefficient, feedback element, function or constant that affects eventual actions: 
                Agent function is an abstract concept as it could incorporate various principles of decision making like calculation of utility of individual options, deduction over logic rules, fuzzy logic, etc.[21] 
                The program agent, instead, maps every possible percept to an action.[22] 
                We use the term percept to refer to the agent's perceptional inputs at any given instant. In the following figures, an agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators. 
                Classes of intelligent agents
                [edit]
                Russell and Norvig's classification
                [edit]
                Russell & Norvig (2003) group agents into five classes based on their degree of perceived intelligence and capability:[23] 
                Simple reflex agents
                [edit]
                Simple reflex agent 
                Simple reflex agents act only on the basis of the current percept, ignoring the rest of the percept history. The agent function is based on the condition-action rule: "if condition, then action". 
                This agent function only succeeds when the environment is fully observable. Some reflex agents can also contain information on their current state which allows them to disregard conditions whose actuators are already triggered. 
                Infinite loops are often unavoidable for simple reflex agents operating in partially observable environments. If the agent can randomize its actions, it may be possible to escape from infinite loops. 
                Model-based reflex agents
                [edit]
                Model-based reflex agent 
                A model-based agent can handle partially observable environments. Its current state is stored inside the agent maintaining some kind of structure that describes the part of the world which cannot be seen. This knowledge about "how the world works" is called a model of the world, hence the name "model-based agent". 
                A model-based reflex agent should maintain some sort of internal model that depends on the percept history and thereby reflects at least some of the unobserved aspects of the current state. Percept history and impact of action on the environment can be determined by using the internal model. It then chooses an action in the same way as reflex agent. 
                An agent may also use models to describe and predict the behaviors of other agents in the environment.[24] 
                Model-based, goal-based agent 
                Goal-based agents further expand on the capabilities of the model-based agents, by using "goal" information. Goal information describes situations that are desirable. This provides the agent a way to choose among multiple possibilities, selecting the one which reaches a goal state. Search and planning are the subfields of artificial intelligence devoted to finding action sequences that achieve the agent's goals. 
                Utility-based agents
                [edit]
                Model-based, utility-based agent 
                Goal-based agents only distinguish between goal states and non-goal states. It is also possible to define a measure of how desirable a particular state is. This measure can be obtained through the use of a utility function which maps a state to a measure of the utility of the state. A more general performance measure should allow a comparison of different world states according to how well they satisfied the agent's goals. The term utility can be used to describe how "happy" the agent is. 
                A rational utility-based agent chooses the action that maximizes the expected utility of the action outcomes - that is, what the agent expects to derive, on average, given the probabilities and utilities of each outcome. A utility-based agent has to model and keep track of its environment, tasks that have involved a great deal of research on perception, representation, reasoning, and learning. 
                A general learning agent 
                Learning has the advantage of allowing agents to initially operate in unknown environments and become more competent than their initial knowledge alone might allow. The most important distinction is between the "learning element", responsible for making improvements, and the "performance element", responsible for selecting external actions. 
                The learning element uses feedback from the "critic" on how the agent is doing and determines how the performance element, or "actor", should be modified to do better in the future. The performance element, previously considered the entire agent, takes in percepts and decides on actions. 
                The last component of the learning agent is the "problem generator". It is responsible for suggesting actions that will lead to new and informative experiences. 
                Weiss's classification
                [edit]
                Weiss (2013) defines four classes of agents: 
                Logic-based agents – in which the decision about what action to perform is made via logical deduction.
                Reactive agents – in which decision making is implemented in some form of direct mapping from situation to action.
                Belief-desire-intention agents – in which decision making depends upon the manipulation of data structures representing the beliefs, desires, and intentions of the agent; and finally,
                Layered architectures – in which decision-making is realized via various software layers, each of which is more or less explicitly reasoning about the environment at different levels of abstraction
                In 2013, Alexander Wissner-Gross published a theory pertaining to Freedom and Intelligence for intelligent agents.[25][26] 
                Hierarchies of agents
                [edit]
                Intelligent agents can be organized hierarchically into multiple "sub-agents". Intelligent sub-agents process and perform lower-level functions. Taken together, the intelligent agent and sub-agents create a complete system that can accomplish difficult tasks or goals with behaviors and responses that display a form of intelligence. 
                Generally, an agent can be constructed by separating the body into the sensors and actuators, and so that it operates with a complex perception system that takes the description of the world as input for a controller and outputs commands to the actuator. However, a hierarchy of controller layers is often necessary to balance the immediate reaction desired for low-level tasks and the slow reasoning about complex, high-level goals.[27] 
                Alternative definitions and uses
                [edit]
                "Intelligent agent" is also often used as a vague term, sometimes synonymous with "virtual personal assistant".[28] Some 20th-century definitions characterize an agent as a program that aids a user or that acts on behalf of a user.[29] These examples are known as software agents, and sometimes an "intelligent software agent" (that is, a software agent with intelligence) is

                WebScraper (to UserProxy):
                
                I have scraped the content from the Wikipedia page on [Intelligent Agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent). Here is a summary of some key points:
                
                1. **Definition**: An intelligent agent (IA) is an agent that perceives its environment, takes autonomous actions to achieve goals, and may enhance its performance through learning or acquiring knowledge.
                
                2. **Examples**:
                   - Simple systems like thermostats or control systems.
                   - Complex systems including humans, firms, states, or biomes.
                
                3. **Artificial Intelligence Association**:
                   - AI is described as the study and design of intelligent agents, focusing on goal-directed behavior.
                   - Rational agents act to maximize the expected value of their objective function.
                
                4. **Applications and Fields**:
                   - Closely linked to economics, cognitive science, ethics, and philosophy.
                   - Used in socio-cognitive modeling and computer social simulations.
                
                5. **Types of Agents** (Based on AI Textbooks):
                   - **Simple Reflex Agents**: Act based on current percepts, ignoring past history.
                   - **Model-based Reflex Agents**: Store internal models of the environment.
                   - **Goal-based Agents**: Use goal information to choose actions.
                   - **Utility-based Agents**: Use utility functions to assess desirability of states.
                   - **Learning Agents**: Improve performance via feedback from the environment.
                
                6. **Philosophical Consideration**:
                   - Definitions avoid linking AI strictly with human intelligence or consciousness.
                
                7. **Hierarchical Organization**:
                   - Intelligent agents can be organized in a hierarchy with sub-agents.
                
                8. **Software Agents**: 
                   - Sometimes the term is used synonymously with virtual personal assistants or software agents acting on behalf of a user.

        Initial plan:

        We are working to address the following user request:

        2개의 숫자를 더하는 Python 프로그램을 만들고 실행해줘


        To answer this request we have assembled the following team:

        WebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.
        Coder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.
        Executor: A agent for executing code
        file_surfer: An agent that can handle local files.



        Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:

        1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS
        - The request is to create and run a Python program that adds two numbers.

        2. FACTS TO LOOK UP
        - None in particular, as the request involves basic Python programming which does not typically require external look-up.

        3. FACTS TO DERIVE
        - How to efficiently write a simple Python program that performs addition of two numbers and execute it.

        4. EDUCATED GUESSES
        - The user might want a small script that takes user input for the two numbers and then prints their sum.


        Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:

        - Use Coder to write a simple Python script that takes two numbers as input from the user and outputs their sum.
        - Pass the script to Executor for execution to demonstrate the functionality.
        - Return the output to the user.

            - **Random Obstacles**: Introduce random obstacles that the snake must avoid.
            - **Multiple Levels**: Implement multiple levels, each with increasing difficulty (more obstacles and faster speed).
            - **Special Items**: Add special items that can temporarily speed up or slow down the snake when eaten.
            - **Scoreboard**: Maintain a scoreboard to track high scores.
        
        2. **Implementation**:
            - Use Pygame for the graphics and game loop.
            - Implement the basic snake game logic first.
            - Add the new features in steps: obstacles, levels, special items, and scoreboard.
        
        3. **Testing**:
            - Test the game to ensure all features work as expected.
            - Check for any logical or functional errors in the game flow.

        Please save the above code in a file named `snakegame.py` and execute it on your computer to test the new features of the snake game. Ensure you have the Pygame library installed (`pip install pygame` if necessary). Let me know once you have executed this, or if you encounter any issues. Once tested, if additional features or adjustments are needed, we can add them. TERMINATE

        Initial plan:

        We are working to address the following user request:

        블로그 작성을 위한 3가지 다른 아이디어가 필요합니다. AI 에이전트에 대한 Trending 주제를 찾아주세요. Google Trends를 사용하고, Youtube에서 인기 있는 주제를 검색하여 3가지 아이디어를 한글로 반환해주세요.


        To answer this request we have assembled the following team:

        WebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.
        Coder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.
        Executor: A agent for executing code
        file_surfer: An agent that can handle local files.
        UserProxy: The current user interacting with you.



        Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:

        1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS
        - The request is for three different blog ideas related to trending topics about AI agents.
        - Sources mentioned for research include Google Trends and YouTube.

        2. FACTS TO LOOK UP
        - Current trending topics about AI agents on Google Trends.
        - Popular topics or videos about AI agents on YouTube.

        3. FACTS TO DERIVE
        - Determine what aspects of AI agents are commonly discussed and why they might be trending.
        - Potential impact or interest generated by these AI agent topics for a blog audience.

        4. EDUCATED GUESSES
        - AI agents related to areas like ChatGPT, AI companionship, AI in gaming, or AI tools for productivity may be trending.
        - There could be a focus on ethical discussions or technological advancements in AI agents based on recent news and developments.


        Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:

        - WebSurfer will visit Google Trends to find current trending topics related to AI agents and summarize the findings.
        - WebSurfer will also search YouTube for popular videos and trending topics related to AI agents and summarize the findings.
        - Coder will compile and present three blog ideas based on the information gathered by WebSurfer from Google Trends and YouTube, ensuring the ideas are relevant and engaging for the target audience.
        - UserProxy will review and provide feedback on the proposed blog ideas to finalize the most suitable topics.
