Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nExecutor: A agent for executing code\nfile_surfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nUserProxy: The current user interacting with you.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request is for three different blog ideas related to trending topics about AI agents.\n   - Sources mentioned for research include Google Trends and YouTube.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Current trending topics about AI agents on Google Trends.\n   - Popular topics or videos about AI agents on YouTube.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine what aspects of AI agents are commonly discussed and why they might be trending.\n   - Potential impact or interest generated by these AI agent topics for a blog audience.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - AI agents related to areas like ChatGPT, AI companionship, AI in gaming, or AI tools for productivity may be trending.\n   - There could be a focus on ethical discussions or technological advancements in AI agents based on recent news and developments.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- WebSurfer will visit Google Trends to find current trending topics related to AI agents and summarize the findings.\n- WebSurfer will also search YouTube for popular videos and trending topics related to AI agents and summarize the findings.\n- Coder will compile and present three blog ideas based on the information gathered by WebSurfer from Google Trends and YouTube, ensuring the ideas are relevant and engaging for the target audience.\n- UserProxy will review and provide feedback on the proposed blog ideas to finalize the most suitable topics.\n", "type": "OrchestrationEvent"}
